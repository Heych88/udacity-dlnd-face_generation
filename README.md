# GAN Face Generation

This repository contains a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used to generate new images of MNIST and CelebA faces using 
Tensorflow for project 5 of the [Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation 
program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) by Udacity.

The Udacity project and course repository can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/).

## Prerequisites

The code is located in a Jupyter Notebook. You can install Jupyter Notebook by installing 
[Anaconda](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-jupyter-using-anaconda-and-conda) or with pip

``` pip3 install jupyter ```

## Installing

Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/Heych88/udacity-dlnd-face_generation.git
```
## Run the Code

Navigate to the cloned directories location and start jupyter notebook with `dlnd_face_generation.ipynb`

```
jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb
```

## Usage

This repository provides an introduction into the Tensorflow implementation of GAN's.
